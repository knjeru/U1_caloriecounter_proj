## Project Overview

The goal of our 'Track It!' software, here at ByteLyfe, is to allow users to track their necessary calories consumed on a daily basis based on measurements of key user parameters. Many people, unfortunately, do not take in the necessary nutrients on a daily basis to sustain their active lifestyles in a healthy way. Using our daily suggested calories goals user's will be able to resolve this problem provided they follow our calculated values.
